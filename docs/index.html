1. Introduction
LiverWise (“the App”) is dedicated to protecting user privacy and upholding global data protection standards. This Privacy Policy details how LiverWise collects, processes, and secures information. The App is an educational and informational wellness platform designed to promote nutrition awareness and ingredient literacy. It is not a medical, diagnostic, or therapeutic application and does not process medical data.

This Policy complies with and exceeds the requirements of:
• Google Play and Apple App Store Data Safety standards.
• General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU 2016/679).
• California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).

2. Data Collected
LiverWise collects only the minimum amount of information necessary for app functionality and user experience enhancement.

2.1 Account Information
• User credentials (email address, password if applicable).

2.2 User Preferences
• Selected “Lifestyle” and “Focus Areas” (e.g., Mediterranean, Liver-Friendly, Bariatric) to filter recipes.
• These are stored as tags within user profiles, not as medical conditions.

2.3 Recipe and Ingredient Data
• Recipes created, saved, or shared by the user.
• Ingredient barcode scans retrieved from the OpenFoodFacts API (ODbL 1.0 License).
• Nutritional facts generated for educational purposes only.

2.4 App Analytics
• Non-identifiable usage metrics such as recipe views, session duration, or feature usage patterns.
• Aggregated and anonymized for improving user experience.

LiverWise does not collect or process medical, diagnostic, biometric, or geolocation data.

3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Compliance)
Processing is based on the following legal grounds:
• User consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
• Legitimate interest in providing and improving educational wellness services (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
• Contractual necessity for providing app functionality (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).

4. Purpose of Data Collection
Data is collected solely to:
• Enable recipe filtering, storage, and ingredient scanning.
• Support AI-assisted recipe formatting for educational purposes.
• Enhance user experience and maintain app functionality.
LiverWise does not use data for profiling, targeted advertising, or health analytics.

5. AI-Assisted Content Transparency
LiverWise uses AI (ChatGPT) and the OpenFoodFacts API for formatting, summarizing, and verifying nutritional information. 
All AI outputs are:
• Manually reviewed by developers before publication.
• Clearly labeled as “AI-assisted educational data.”
• Derived from publicly available, non-personal datasets.

6. Data Security
LiverWise uses Supabase with the following protections:
• End-to-end encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit).
• Row-Level Security (RLS) for user data isolation.
• Access controls restricting data to authorized developers only.
• Periodic vulnerability and compliance audits.

In case of a data breach, LiverWise will notify affected users within 72 hours, consistent with GDPR Article 33.

7. Data Retention
Data is retained only as long as the account remains active. Upon deletion or inactivity exceeding 12 months, all data—including backups—will be permanently deleted.

8. Data Access and User Rights
Users may exercise the following rights at any time:
• Right to access data (GDPR Article 15).
• Right to rectification (Article 16).
• Right to erasure (“Right to be Forgotten,” Article 17).

9. Data Transfers
LiverWise operates from the United States and complies with international transfer mechanisms:
• Data transfers outside the U.S. follow Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) under GDPR.
• Cross-border processing is limited to trusted service providers (e.g., Supabase, OpenAI, OpenFoodFacts).

10. Third-Party Access and APIs
• OpenFoodFacts API is used for publicly available food data retrieval only; no user data is transmitted to this API.
• Supabase hosts encrypted data on secure U.S.-based servers.
• No third-party advertisers or data brokers have access to user data.

11. Children’s Privacy
LiverWise is designed for users 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from minors. Users under 18 are prohibited from creating accounts.

12. Cookies and Local Storage
LiverWise may use secure local storage for login persistence. No third-party cookies, trackers, or behavioral analytics are used.

13. Data Integrity and Audit Trails
All database transactions are logged with timestamp and developer identifier. This ensures transparency, auditability, and compliance with internal governance.

14. Policy Updates and Version Control
Policy updates are versioned and logged with a “Last Updated” date visible both in-app and on the LiverWise website. Substantive updates trigger a user notification requiring acknowledgment before continued use.

15. Developer Accountability
Developers Brittney Hanna (Developer / Administrator) and Terry Dodson Jr. (Sr. Programmer / Administrator) share joint responsibility for compliance with this policy. 
They ensure adherence to Google Play, Apple Store, and applicable privacy regulations.
